### What interns look like

> An ideal intern is smart, independent, and eager to learn. Interns donâ€™t need to know the exact languages we develop in before they arrive (although that would be a bonus), but they should be familiar with the MVC design pattern. Ideal interns will understand the principles behind strongly typed, functional, and object-oriented development.  

> Interns should display a passion for making awesome things and a knack for making them better through iteration, user testing, and refactoring. Elegance is idolized, but functional is realistic.
