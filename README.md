### What interns look like

> An ideal intern is smart, independent, and eager to learn. Interns don’t need to know the exact languages we develop in before they arrive (although that would be a bonus), but they should be familiar with the MVC design pattern. Ideal interns will understand the principles behind strongly typed, functional, and object-oriented development.  

> Interns should display a passion for making awesome things and a knack for making them better through iteration, user testing, and refactoring. Elegance is idolized, but functional is realistic.


## BlkDot

[Website](http://theblkdot.com/)

Located in Portland, OR

> BlkDot helps small to medium-sized online businesses post shoppable content on major social media channels from one easy to use dashboard.

### The stack

* HTML5
* CSS3
* Javascript
* jQuery
* [PHP](http://php.net/)

### What interns will work on

* Using PHP, work with an existing MVC application that imports products from online storefronts and writes them out to social media outlets.
* Work with [OpenGraph](http://ogp.me/) tags to ensure posts look good on all networks.
* Consume / create REST APIs.
* Build graphs out of analytics data.
* Write automated deployment scripts.
* Work with [OAuth](http://oauth.net/).
* Implement third-party [SDKs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_kit) to consume products from new stores.
* Image manipulation.
* Utilize [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](http://aws.amazon.com/).

### What interns look like

> We’re looking for aspiring front-end / back-end developers who can help us realize our product vision and have a good time doing it. Many of the things you’ll be working on are in various states of realization; you’ll likely get to help shape how they ultimately work in addition to just implementing them.

>You should be strong with PHP, HTML5/CSS3, JavaScript and jQuery and be able to see a feature all the way through implementation from the bottom up. Experience with Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook, Google+ and Pinterest a major plus. Bonus points if you have an Etsy store :)
